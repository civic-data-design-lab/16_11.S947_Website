between MIT and KACST in Riyadh, bringing together
multi-disciplinary teams, combining designers,
planners, engineers, physicists, and
computer scientists. On its Phase III, the current
iteration of the project focuses on the development
research for the construction of an “Integrated
Transportation System” for Riyadh. The
project is overseen at MIT by Sarah Williams
(DUSP), and Marta Gonzalez (CEE), and at KACST
by Dr. Mansour Alsaleh and Dr. Areej Alwabil.
The overall project is an attempt to theorize
about the implications of the dramatic changes
Riyadh’s transit infrastructure will experience
after the introduction of the upcoming metro
and bus system.</p>

            <p class = "texts">Motivated by the rapidly growing population
demand (e.g. Riyadh’s population has doubled in
the last 15 years), the upcoming transportation
system introduces the largest public transit
system implemented from scratch in a city with
no form of public transportation. The transportation
system is the largest urban public transportation
project in the world, with the rapid integration
of 6 metro lines (87 stations), 24 bus
routes (nearly 4,000 bus stops), and 20 parking
stations. In a city dominated by cars, with no pedestrian
infrastructure and where women
cannot drive, the introduction of the public
transportation system will transform the urban
and social dynamics of Riyadh.</p>
