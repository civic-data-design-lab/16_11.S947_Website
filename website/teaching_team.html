Sarah Williams is currently an Assistant Professor of Urban Planning and the Director of the Civic Data
Design Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s School of Architecture and Planning. The Civic
Data Design Lab employs data visualization and mapping techniques to expose and communicate urban
patterns and policy issues to broader audiences. Before coming to MIT, Williams was Co-Director of the
Spatial Information Design Lab at Columbia University. Sarah has won numerous awards, including being
named top 25 planners in technology and 2012 Game Changer by Metropolis Magazine. Her work is currently
on view in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York.

Carlos is an architect that specializes in computational design. Before joining the Design and Computation
Group at MIT, he was a research scientist at UC Berkeley, investigating the convergence of design, data
science, and social sciences. In the past four years, Carlos has been a Lecturer at UC Berkeley and a Visiting
Professor at UNAM, and has taught computational design seminars and workshops in the United
States, Italy, China and Mexico. His work has been supported by numerous fellowships, more recently by
the IDEA Studio Fellowship at Autodesk, the National Council of Science and Technology, and the Jumex
Foundation for Contemporary Arts. He is interested in urban data visualization, histories of computing in
urban design tools, and technological platforms for design collaboration.
